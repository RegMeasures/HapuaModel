def longShoreTransport(ShoreY, Dx, WavePower, WavePeriod, Wlen_h, EDir_h, PhysicalPars):
    """ Calculates longshore transport rate for each shore segment
    
        Longshore transport rate is calculated using the CERC sediment 
        transport formula (CERC 1984). The calculation is performed for the 
        whole model for a single timestep.
        
        Parameters:
            ShoreY (np.ndarray(float64)): The first column of ShoreY specifies 
                the shoreline position at each shore profile relative to a 
                straight line through the initial shoreline position (m).
            Dx (float): Alongshore discretisation distance between shore 
                profiles in ShoreY (m).
            WavePower (float): Wave power (W/m wave crest length) 
            Wlen_h: (float): Wavelength (m) at depth given by
                PhysicalPars['WaveDataDepth'] 
            EDir_h (float): Net direction of wave energy flux (in radians,
                relative to shore normal, -ve = waves arriving from left of 
                shore-normal, +ve = waves arriving from right of shore-normal)
                 at depth given by PhysicalPars['WaveDataDepth'].
            PhysicalPars: Physical parameters including:
                BreakerCoef (float): see notes below.
                K2coef (float): see notes below.
                Gravity (float): (ms^-2)
                WaveDataDepth (float): depth at which input wave data is 
                    specified (m)
        
        Returns:
            LST (np.ndarray(float64)): Longshore transport rate at each 
                shoreline segment between 2 nodes (m^3/s)
        
        Notes: 
            The calculation uses PhysicalPars['K2coef'] as a transport 
                coefficient, but this has already been calculated in 
                loadmod.loadModel as:
                    K2 = K / (RhoSed - RhoSea) * g * (1 - VoidRatio))
            PhysicalPars['BreakerCoef'] is calculated in loadmod.loadModel as:
                BreakerCoef = 8 / (RhoSea * Gravity^1.5 * GammaRatio^2)
            EDir_h is required in radians. Conversion from degrees to radians
                is done by loadmod.loadModel when the wave timeseries are read
                during model initialisation.
